# Exercises and Solution Notes
## 1.1
- [x] Refactor the code so it consists of three new components: `Header`, `Content`, `Total`
  - At this point, the new components are defined in `App.js`

- Kept everything pretty simple. Each part and the number of exercises for said part is passed in an array to three different props in the `Content` component.
- Used `reduce` to get the total number of exercises

## 1.2
- [x] Refactor the `Content` component so it doesn't render any names of parts or their number of exercies by itself. 

- Made a new `Part` component that takes the part name and the number of exercises associated with it as props.

## 1.3
- [x] Modify the variable definitions and refactor accordingly

## 1.4
- [x] Once again, modify the variable definitions, this time by placing the objects in an array. Refactor accordingly.
  - At this point, assume there are always three items - no loops yet at this point, but do not pass the different objects as eparate props and instead pass them directly as an array

## 1.5
- [x] Change the course and its parts into a single JS object. Refactor accordingly.
