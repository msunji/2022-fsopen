# Exercises and Solution Notes
## 1.1
- [x] Refactor the code so it consists of three new components: `Header`, `Content`, `Total`
  - At this point, the new components are defined in `App.js`

- Kept everything pretty simple. Each part and the number of exercises for said part is passed in an array to three different props in the `Content` component.
- Used `reduce` to get the total number of exercises

## 1.2
- [x] Refactor the `Content` component so it doesn't render any names of parts or their number of exercies by itself. 

- Made a new `Part` component that takes the part name and the number of exercises associated with it as props.
